# Adding new components to IPTS Styles

This style library uses design tokens to ensure consistency across components. When adding a new component, please follow these guidelines:
1. **Design Tokens**: Use the existing design tokens for colors, typography, spacing, etc. If you need new tokens, please propose them in a separate issue for review.
2. **Component Structure**: Follow the established structure for components, including naming conventions and file organization. Everything should be exported from the root of the library so the consuming app needs only one import.
